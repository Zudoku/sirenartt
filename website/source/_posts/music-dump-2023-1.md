Time for a music dump, once again. :-)

Its been interesting to reflect on what kind of music I usually listen to. I have noticed that my music taste has begun to drift towards more simpler and somehow more similiar or repetitive music than previously. Usually I have really enjoyed to try to find something different. But I keep coming back to lofi and house, time and time again.

Some of the best from the past maybe 6 months: 
* [DJ Windows 7 - Atrapando Sentimientos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DQ9VdEzKdE)
* [B from E - Always Sunny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUPMG1icEao)
* [Vitess - Panama Peppers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6owGUhLjIsg)
* [THEOS - Rhodes Trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7guRO0Uz_c)
