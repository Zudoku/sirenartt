Time to dust off this blog and start pumping out my thoughts on record. 
Since the last two years have been heavily affected by corona, I have felt that Id rather do something else than write something on a computer to a blog that nobody will read.
However, now I feel like that im ready for a round 2 again. 

To put it shortly, the last 2 years has been a wild ride. At first, I remember wathing these weird videos on reddit from china about some random disease and people being dragged from their homes to hospital and some speculation if it will hit the rest of the world.
The next thing I know, Finland was locked down and people were hoarding food and toilet paper. It felt weird seeing my local market empty of food. It is fun to laugh at that time now, but a part of me still feels creepy and scared about the potential of what it could have been: absolute chaos.

In the summer of 2020, I started a new hobby, brewing beerr. I think it started from a random video about microbrewing, but now it has become one of my most loved hobby. 
I started off with trying to brew a wheat beer, but it went horribly wrong. My thrid try became close to being actually drinkable :D. 

I also ran my first marathon in 2020. That was actually really brutal. I ran it on october 2020 with my work pal Petri, 5:20:44 was my time, so pretty close to almost not getting a time as 6 hours was the limit.
I tried to practice as best I could, running 5-8 km distances regularly, and some 10km runs as well. What shocked me, was proper nutrition during the marathon. I felt after 20kms that I was running out of juice, and that the pickles and energy drink was not enough to provide me to the finish line.
I ended up eating quite of many energy gels that my friend Petri had, providing an extra energy boost making it possible for me to finish the thing. At the very end, I had to walk some distances (500m-1000m at a time) but almost all of the marathon was running.


Fast forward to the spring, summer and autumn of 2021, got my vaccines, and now it feels like the world is opening up again. It is allowed to go to metro without a mask even though it is recommended.

Currently, I am changing workplaces and on a holiday. I am started to get hooked into retro gaming. Just recently bought a Gameboy Advance SP for 129â‚¬ 2 weeks ago, and I already have 15h on it, afaik. I am heavily thinking about buying a xbox (the original of course). 
I want to play Jet Set Radio Future as well as Transworld snowboarding, and maybe ratchet and clank. (even though i never had it, and its more of a ps2 thing)
During covid, I played TBC classic, but lost my interest after the completing first tier of raids.

Super pumped about the Bomb Rush Cyberfunk relase, seems like a complete spiritual successor to JSRF. [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mptdlfRJkw)

Also recently found about 2 Mello. Crazy talented artist... The two Jet set Radio related albums have been fire: [Memories Of Tokyo-To](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBt8ioYEXBw) [Sounds Of Tokyo-To Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upIDgvEJrlg)

As a last thought, web3 is interesting. Just now recently read more about it more. Seems a bit unclear, how web2 and web3 would work together. I dont feel like the leap will occur instantenously, so interoperation might be a big thing, however how apps work and how 2 and 3 work together, seems a bit unclear.
It is super interesting though. Might look into web3 some more as it seems to be how the future might be. ATM feel like the crypto space is a bit inflated, I kinda want to buy etherium, but at these prices it feels so dumb. 
Most likely there will be one more crash before a mainstream usage of desentraliced shiet.
