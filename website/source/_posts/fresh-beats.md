Fresh beats:
[jamesjamesjames](https://soundcloud.com/jamesjamesjamess). 

Most of the tracks have distinct but very unique lo-fi sound with 90s-00s aesthetics. The music videos feature old pop stars in grainy pictures and samples from songs from that era giving the listener a sense that we are still in 2004 or 1998. Very clean.

Songs that I would definitely recommend:

* [snctm. - omokage w/ jamesjamesjames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6alrXgdTwPI)
* [jamesjamesjames - Glamorous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YERGdRtm5q0)
* [jamesjamesjames & snctm. - homesoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SvjhsmPsRA)
* [jamesjamesjames - Ciara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47sphgmvhsg)
* [jamesjamesjames - Nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u2maIx6t7s)
