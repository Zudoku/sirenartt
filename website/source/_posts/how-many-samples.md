This song [Trauv - Want You Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt9yRlQ8zvw) popped up in my subscription feed and I immediately recognized it as being something i had heard earlier, but with a different name. I quickly searched and found these two songs:

that had the same exact vocals.

Originally I was going to write about how lately I have found a weird trend of artists taking vocals of some song and changing the beat and melody to create a remix of that song, but completely change the name of the track and not giving any recognition back to the original artist. I found that to be kinda strange, but it being the music industry, anything is possible. Instead i found something even more horrifying... Not really, it actually makes sense. :D 

In the comments someone mentioned that the vocals were from ['Ultra Tropical House Vocals 3'](https://vandalism-sounds.com/ultra-tropical-house-vocals-3.html) and a quick google search finds it to be a buyable pack of different vocals to use in your songs. After listening to the samples I instantly recognized more familiar sounds.

I don't know why this bothered me, but it did a little bit. I find it great that this exists, and with my limited knowledge of producing music as a very bad hobbyist I love these kinds of things. Still something in me doesn't like it and I wish I didn't know. Sampling in music is very normal and it happens __EVERYWHERE__. I guess I fear that these packs will become really popular and that I can listen to these packs ahead of time and all of the songs that use the vocals will be instantly ruined for me. 

Or that great songs made with the vocals will get buried under the countless other mediocre songs that also do, and that accidentally hearing the other mediocre songs will affect the way I feel about the one great song. I dont know...
